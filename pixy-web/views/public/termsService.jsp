        <span>At times, the Service will permit You to "buy", "purchase" or “exchange” for use in the Service: (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual diamonds or virtual stars; or (b) virtual in-Service items (“gifts”), including but not limited to jewelry and fashion items, cars, boats, stickers, or other gifts (together with virtual currency, "Virtual Items"). These real world terms, however, are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, PIXY grants You a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that include the use of these Virtual Items.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>A purchase of Virtual Items is complete only when you receive confirmation through the Service that You have redeemed iTunes or Google Play Store Wallet credits, or other third party currency accepted by the Service. When you use the third party payment system you will leave the PIXY and PIXY will not control such third party payment system and PIXY shall not be liable for any usage of the third party payment system. It is your obligation to confirm the terms and security of third payment system, if you do not agree to use such payment system, please do not submit your information to and make any payment on the third party payment system platform.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Any virtual currency balance shown in Your PIXY Account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license to use the Virtual Items within the Service. PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to modify or revise the price of the Virtual Items and the exchange rate when converting stars to diamonds or stars to real currency from time to time. Further, PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to terminate Your exchange of stars into diamonds or real currency. You will not be able to receive a refund of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), if Your access to the Service has been suspended, limited or terminated.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Tips and other Virtual Items gifted to broadcasters may result in some revenue to them as determined in PIXY's sole discretion; however, PIXY makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the Virtual Items You may give a broadcaster will correlate to the revenue such broadcaster may receive from PIXY. </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to modify or revise the price of the Virtual Items and the exchange rate when converting stars to diamonds or stars to real currency from time to time. Further, PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to stop the exchange of stars into diamonds or real currency. </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Only users of the Service who initiate a broadcast will be eligible for Tips and other Virtual items. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">10. RIGHT TO SHUT DOWN, DENY OR LIMIT ACCESS, REMOVE CONTENT</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>PIXY has the right, but not the obligation, to screen, refuse to post, remove or edit the Content, at any time and for any or no reason at all, in our sole discretion.

        <br><br>
        <span>In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to PIXY under the Terms of Use or applicable law, PIXY expressly reserves the right to suspend, limit or terminate Your access to the Service, at any time with or without notice and with or without cause, including if PIXY determines, in PIXY's sole discretion, that You pose a threat to the Service or its users. In addition, PIXY may refer any information on illegal activities, including Your identity, to the proper authorities.</span>
