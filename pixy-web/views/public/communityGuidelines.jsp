      <p class="title">Community Guidelines</p>
      <p class="effective">Last Updated: June 16th, 2016</p>
      <p class="text1 common_word">
        <span>At PIXY, our mission is to provide the best live video broadcast and streaming platform created by the community where broadcasters and viewers can interact in real time. To achieve this goal, we ask that all users participate in such a way that promotes a safe and positive experience for our global audience.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>To protect the integrity of our community, as the provider of the service, we at PIXY reserve the right to suspend any account at any time for any conduct that we determine to be inappropriate or harmful. You are free to appeal your suspension, but we are not required to provide a reason for our decision.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>Enjoy PIXY! Please be decent to one another. PIXY reserves the right to allow sensitive content when it is artistic, educational, scientific or newsworthy. Please remember that PIXY is not to be used for any unlawful purposes or in furtherance of illegal activities.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span>There are a few guidelines intended to keep PIXY open and safe. If you find yourself asking whether or not you're crossing the line, chances are you shouldn't do it.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head1 head_common">Breaking the law</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>You must respect all applicable local, national, and international laws while using our services. Any content or activity featuring or encouraging illegal activity is prohibited.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Posting pornographic or overtly sexual content</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>PIXY is intended to be open and safe. To maintain a healthy platform, explicit graphic content is not allowed. Explicit graphic content includes, but is not limited to, depictions of child abuse, animal abuse, or bodily harm. PIXY is not for content that is intended to incite violence, or includes a direct and specific threat of violence to others. PIXY reserves the right to allow sensitive content when it is artistic, educational, scientific or newsworthy.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Nudity and/or sexually explicit behavior is not permitted</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Users of all ages may not expose genitalia in any way or perform sexual or sexually suggestive acts, show sex toys onscreen, or dance in a sexually suggestive manner. Encouragement of nudity is prohibited and users are not allowed to use vulgar, profane, or sexually explicit language on camera or in the chat.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">You must be at least 13 years of age </p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>PIXY is intended for individuals ages 13 and older. If we become aware of an account that belongs to an individual under 13, that account will be terminated. Users who are older than 13 may have guests on camera who are under 13, but underage guests may not appear alone on broadcast.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Other sexually explicit conduct</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Any activity involving pornography, sexual intercourse, or adult services is prohibited. Conduct involving exploitation of minors will be reported to authorities via the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Broadcasting Sexually Explicit, Adults-Only, or Other Prohibited Games</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Nudity cannot be a focus of the live broadcast or live stream and occurrences of nudity are not allowed. Occurrences of in-game nudity are permitted, so long as you do not make them a primary focus of your broadcast and only spend as much time as needed in the area to progress the game's story. Games rated Adults Only (AO) by the ESRB are not permitted for broadcast on PIXY.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Depictions of nudity and violence</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>We ask that you refrain from creating or using depictions of nudity or extreme violence for the time being. We are currently working on site features that will allow for responsible broadcasting and viewing of legitimate artistic depictions of nudity and violence. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Inappropriate broadcaster behavior and attire</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Nudity and conduct involving overtly sexual behavior and/or attire are prohibited.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Self-Destructive Behavior</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Any activity that may endanger your life or lead to your physical harm is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to: suicide threats, intentional physical trauma, use of illegal drugs, or drinking excessively.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Targeted bullying, harassment, threats, and violence against others</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Harassment, defamation, intimidation, raiding with malicious intent, or stalking of other persons or users, including PIXY Staff, Admins, or Global Moderators, is strictly prohibited.<br><br>

      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Impersonation</p>
      <p class="text_top common_word">
        <span>Content or activity meant to impersonate an individual or organization is prohibited. Any attempts to misrepresent yourself as a member of PIXY Staff, Admins, or moderators is a zero-tolerance violation and will result in immediate indefinite suspension.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="head_top head_common">Spam, scams, and other malicious conduct</p>
