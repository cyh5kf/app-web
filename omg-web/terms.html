            <span>This is an agreement between Algento Cloud Computing Limited ("OMG"), the owner and operator of <a class="email" href="https://itsomg.com">itsomg.com</a> (the "OMG Site"), the OMG software and OMG Client and Content (collectively, including all content available through the OMG Client and Content and OMG Site, the "OMG Service", or the "Service"), and you ("you" or "You"), a user of the Service.</span>
            <br><br>

          <p class="head_top head_common">2. OMG Service</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the OMG Service. Information provided by users may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by OMG. OMG has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, OMG will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that OMG shall not be responsible for any damages, claims or other liability arising from or related to your use of any third-party website.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="head_top head_common">3. OMG Access</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span><span class="black_bold">A.</span> Subject to your compliance with these Terms, OMG hereby grants you permission to use the Service, provided that: (i) your use of the Service as permitted is solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (ii) you will not duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without OMG's prior written authorization; (iii) you will not attempt to reverse engineer, alter or modify any part of the Service; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">B.</span> In order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide OMG with your phone number. You expressly acknowledge and agree that in order to provide the Service, OMG may periodically access your contact list and/or address book on your mobile device to find and keep track of mobile phone numbers of other users of the Service. When providing your phone number, you must provide accurate and complete information. You hereby give your express consent to OMG to use the phone numbers you provide for use in providing you access and use of the Service. You may never use another person's phone number without their permission. We do not collect addresses or email addresses, just mobile phone numbers. You are solely responsible for the status message that is displayed for your phone number. You must notify OMG immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your phone. Although OMG will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of OMG or others due to such unauthorized use.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">C.</span> You agree not to use or launch any automated system,including without limitation, "robots," "spiders,""offline readers," etc. or "load testers" such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the OMG servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a OMG application, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, OMG grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the OMG website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. OMG reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by OMG clients. We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="head_top head_common">4. Intellectual Property Rights</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>The design of the OMG Service along with all text, scripts, graphics (including stickers), interactive features and the like made available in connection with the OMG Service (collectively, the "OMG Client and Content"), except all User Status Submissions (as defined below), and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to OMG, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. Subject to these Terms of Service, you are granted a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, limited license to install and use, only in connection with the Service, the OMG Client and Content for personal and non-commercial purposes only. The Service, including the OMG Client and Content, is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal non-commercial use only. OMG reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the OMG Client and Content. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, distribution or other exploitation of any of the OMG Client and Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of User Status Submissions of third parties obtained through the Service for any commercial purposes. You further agree not to use the OMG Client and Content in a manner that would infringe or violate the rights of any third party and that we are not in any way responsible for any such use by you.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="head_top head_common">5. User Status Submissions and Direct Messages</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span><span class="black_bold">A.</span> The OMG Service allows OMG users to submit User Status Submissions (as defined below) and Direct Messages (as defined below). These User Status Submissions and Direct Messages may be hosted, shared, and/or published as part of the OMG Service, and may be visible to other users of the Service who have your mobile phone number in their mobile phone and which you have not expressly blocked. Direct Messages will only be viewable by those OMG user(s) or group(s) you directly send such information; but User Status Submissions may be globally viewed by OMG users that have your mobile phone number on their smartphone, unless the user is blocked by you. For purposes of these Terms of Service, User Status Submission refers to status text, profile photos and other communications other than Direct Messages submitted by you, as well as the automatic submission of your "last seen" status. Direct Messages refers to text, voice, photo, video, location and contact information messages you send directly to other OMG users or groups.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Currently, we have no method of providing different levels of visibility of your User Status Submissions among users that have your mobile phone number. You acknowledge and agree that any User Status Submissions may be globally viewed by users that have your mobile phone number. For this reason, you should not submit User Status Submissions that you would not want to be seen globally. The submission of your 'last seen' status is done on an automatic basis. As clarified in the following section, you retain your ownership rights in your User Status Submissions. You understand that whether or not such User Status Submissions are published, OMG does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any such submissions.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">B.</span> You shall be solely responsible for your own User Status Submissions and Direct Messages and the consequences of posting or publishing them. Because OMG is only acting as a repository of data, user submitted statuses do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of OMG, and OMG makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any status. In connection with User Status Submissions and Direct Messages, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize OMG to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Status Submissions and Direct Messages to enable inclusion and use of the User Status Submissions and Direct Messages in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Status Submission and Direct Messages to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Status Submissions and Direct Messages in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Status Submissions and Direct Messages, but you have to have the rights in the first place. However, by submitting the User Status Submissions to OMG, you hereby grant OMG a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Status Submissions in connection with the OMG Service and OMG's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the OMG Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on the OMG Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Status Submissions through the Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a User Status Submission from the OMG Service.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">C.</span> In connection with User Status Submissions and Direct Messages, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant OMG all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage OMG or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person; (vi) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein; or (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">D.</span> Adult content must be identified as such. OMG does not endorse any User Status Submission, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and OMG expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Status Submissions. OMG does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights via its Service, and OMG will remove all Content, User Status Submissions if properly notified that such Content, User Status Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. OMG reserves the right to remove Content, User Status Submissions without prior notice. OMG may also terminate a user's access to its Service, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer, or for any or no reason, including being annoying. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than once and/or has had a User Status Submission from the Service more than twice. An annoying person is anyone who is (capriciously or not) determined to be annoying by authorized OMG, its employees or agents. OMG also reserves the right to decide whether content or a User Status Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to excessive length or limited interest. OMG may remove such User Status Submissions, and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">E.</span> You understand that when using the OMG Service you will be exposed to User Status Submissions and Direct Messages from a variety of sources, and that OMG is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Status Submissions and Direct Messages, and that such User Status Submissions and Direct Messages are not the responsibility of OMG. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Status Submissions and Direct Messages that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against OMG with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold OMG, its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the Service.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">F.</span> OMG permits you to link to materials on the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes only. Commercial versions may be available under separate licensing and terms. OMG reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the OMG Service at any time.</span>

            <br><br>
            <span>OMG will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to OMG's Copyright Agent:</span>

          <p class="head_top head_common">Privacy Policy</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>Algento ("OMG") cares about the privacy of its customers, visitors and users. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information. If you do not agree to our practices, please do not use the OMG website, Software,or Services.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the OMG Terms. Your use of the OMG website, Software and Service and any personal information you provide on such website and Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Please note that any User Status Submissions or other content posted at the direction or discretion of users of the OMG Service becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that OMG does not own or control, or to individuals whom OMG does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which OMG may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="head_top head_common">How We Collect and Use Information</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>OMG may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below ("Personally Identifying Information"):</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">User Provided Information:</span> You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number, push notification name (if applicable), billing information (if applicable) and mobile device information to OMG when choosing to participate in various uses of the OMG Service, such as registering as a user, updating your status or requesting status for your contacts. In order to provide the OMG Service, OMG will periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other OMG users ("in-network" numbers), or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as "out-network" numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">Cookies Information:</span> When you visit the OMG Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. OMG uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the OMG Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span><span class="black_bold">Log File Information:</span> When you use the OMG Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, your phone number, phone number you are requesting the status of and various status information. When you use the OMG Service, our servers log certain general information that our application sends whenever a message is sent or received, or if you update or request any status information, including time and date stamps and the mobile phone numbers the messages were sent from and to.</span>
          <p class="head_top head_common">The Information OMG Does Not Collect</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>OMG does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users' mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers-the OMG mobile application will associate whatever name the OMG user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list - and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on OMG's servers and is not transmitted to OMG. This means that if you have your friend's mobile phone number associated with the name "Alice" in your mobile address book, that's the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your OMG contact list. We do not collect location data, but users may voluntarily share their location with other users via the OMG Service.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>The contents of messages that have been delivered by the OMG Service are not copied, kept or archived by OMG in the normal course of business. The OMG Service is meant to be a SMS replacement, using data service through a user's phone (either via cell network or wifi). Users type their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient (who must also be a OMG user), if that recipient is online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in OMG's server until it can be delivered. If the message is undelivered for seven (7) days, the undelivered message is deleted from our servers. Once a message has been delivered, it no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered messages are not kept or retained by OMG - the only records of the content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender's and recipient's mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user's option). Notwithstanding the above, OMG may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which OMG is legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through the OMG Service will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are deleted and stripped of any identifiable information within a short period of time in accordance with our general retention policies.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="head_top head_common">The Way OMG Uses Information</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the OMG Site, or OMG Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the OMG Site and OMG Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the OMG Service and will be retained. If you provide billing information, such billing information will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with OMG. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status content that you voluntarily disclose on the OMG Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the OMG Service (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when you update your status messages through the OMG Service and other users may contact you through the OMG Service. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major OMG Site or OMG Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the OMG Site and OMG Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. Hopefully we improve the OMG Site and Service and don't make it suck worse. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the OMG Service or OMG Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="head_top head_common">When OMG Discloses Information</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>Other users of the OMG Service may see your User Status Submissions in a way that is consistent with the use of the OMG Service. For example, a status of "Driving in car" set by a specific phone number will be available to every user of the OMG Service who has that mobile phone number in their mobile phone's address book or contact list, unless you have chosen to block such user. "Last Seen" information is available and displayed to each user who has your mobile phone number in their mobile phone address book or contact book (and which you have not blocked), and reflects the last approximate time the OMG mobile application has been used or brought to the foreground on your mobile phone. "Last Seen" information is reported to OMG when a user brings the mobile application to the foreground.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the OMG Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the OMG Site. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual's physical safety may be at risk or threatened. OMG also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that OMG believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the OMG Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of OMG, our users or others.</span>

          <p class="head_top head_common">Your Choices</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the OMG Site or the OMG Service, in which case OMG may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please delete your account, uninstall the OMG mobile application and discontinue use of the OMG Service; your continued usage of the OMG Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and granting you access to the OMG Service. Please contact OMG via email to <span class="email">contact@itsomg.com</span> about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.</span>

          <p class="head_top head_common">Our Commitment To Data Security</p>
          <p class="text_top common_word">
            <span>OMG uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, OMG makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If OMG learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. OMG may post a notice on the OMG Site or through the OMG Service if a security breach occurs.</span>

In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</span>
