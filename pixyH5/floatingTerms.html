        <p class="head_top head_common">1. BASIC TERMS</p>
        <p class="text_top common_word">
          <span>You are responsible for your use of PIXY Services, for any Content you post to PIXY, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms. The Content you share with others may be viewed around the world, including on the third party services and websites</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>You may use PIXY only if you can form a binding contract with Instanza, Inc. and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using PIXY on behalf of a government, company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use PIXY only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>The PIXY Services are always evolving and the form and nature of PIXY may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Instanza, Inc. may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing PIXY (or any features within PIXY) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="head_top head_common">2. REGISTRATION</p>
        <p class="text_top common_word">
          <span>In order to access some features of the Service, and to be able to Submit (as that term is defined below) Content as a broadcaster, You will have to create a PIXY account via Your Email, Facebook®, Twitter®, or Instagram® account, using the same information provided to one of those networks (the “PIXY Account”). You can alter such information by updating Your Facebook®, Twitter®, or Instagram® account (this will automatically update Your PIXY Account the next time You log in). You also may alter Your PIXY Account information by logging into the Service and accessing Your settings.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>You agree not to share Your PIXY Account password or let others have access to Your Account and You will not attempt to transfer Your PIXY Account to anyone else. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through Your account, so we urge You to keep Your account password secure and to always log-off when leaving Your computer or mobile device unattended. Although PIXY will not be liable for losses caused by any unauthorized use of Your PIXY Account, You may be liable for the losses of PIXY or others due to unauthorized use. We strongly recommend that You notify us immediately of unauthorized use of Your PIXY Account or of any related security breach by contacting us at <span class="email">support@pixy.tv</span>. If for any reason You want to limit Your children's access to the Service, there are a number of commercially available parental control protections.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="head_top head_common">3. OWNERSHIP OF THE SERVICE</p>
        <p class="text_top common_word">

        <p class="head_top head_common">4. CONTENT ON PIXY SERVICES</p>

          <span>The term “Content” refers to any information, data, communication, video, text, graphics, photos (including but not limited to “Selfies” and “Moments”), sounds, music, audiovisual works, chat feed comments, gifting and/or other contributions appearing on the Service that users of the Service may broadcast, upload, or otherwise submit (collectively, “Submit”) to the Service, or view or access on the Service.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>All Content, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such Content. We may, but are not required to monitor or control the Content posted via PIXY and we cannot take responsibility for such Content. Any use or reliance on any Content or materials posted via PIXY or obtained by You through PIXY is at Your own risk.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or communications posted via PIXY or endorse any opinions expressed via PIXY. You understand that by using PIXY, You may be exposed to Content that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Instanza be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via PIXY or broadcast elsewhere.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>We may offer You the opportunity to invite Your friends or contacts to view Your streams or otherwise enjoy the Services.

You may be able to edit that suggested content, and if You choose to send text message invitations, those messages will be sent from the native SMS application on Your device. If You do choose to send such invitations, You represent to PIXY that the recipients of such invitations have consented to receive such messages from You, and that those recipients do not consider such messages unwanted or unsolicited.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="head_top head_common">5. USER GENERATED CONTENT RIGHTS</p>
        <p class="text_top common_word">
          <span>The term “Content” refers to any information, data, communication, video, text, graphics, photos (including but not limited to “Selfies” and “Moments”), sounds, music, audiovisual works, chat feed comments, gifting and/or other contributions appearing on the Service that users of the Service may broadcast, upload, or otherwise submit (collectively, “Submit”) to the Service, or view or access on the Service.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>All right, title and interest in Content Submitted by You to the Service, to the extent it does not belong to third parties or Guests (see Section 5), will remain with You, subject to the licenses You make hereunder. PIXY does not and will not claim any ownership over such Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You hereby waive any moral rights that You may have in Your Content in favor of PIXY and anyone acting with the authorization of PIXY.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>PIXY assumes no responsibility for Content Submitted by You or any other users of the Service. You shall be solely liable for Content that You Submit to the Service, including without limitation for any consequences of publishing the Content through the Service. Your potential liability applies, for example, to any Content that You include in a broadcast initiated by You, even if you are not the creator of that Content.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>You hereby affirm, represent and warrant that You will own or obtain all necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to enable PIXY to publish and otherwise utilize as authorized in the Terms of Use, the Content You Submit to the Service.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>You understand that the Service is intended for public use and not for private communications, and You confirm that You have no expectation of privacy with regard to any Content You may Submit to the Service, or any other communication by You made to or through the Service. Furthermore, You are aware that PIXY does not guarantee the security of any information You disclose via the Service and any submission of Content by You to the Service is made at Your own risk.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>All of the provisions in this Section 5 shall apply with equal force if You Submit Content that includes advertorials, native advertising, or sponsorship (“Sponsored Content”). Without limitation, all of Your representations, warranties, indemnification obligations, and other obligations under the Terms of Use will apply equally to Sponsored Content as they would to any other Content You Submit. You are solely responsible for ensuring that Your Sponsored Content complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation the Federal Trade Commission’s Guides Concerning Endorsements and Testimonials (“FTC Guidelines”), including all required disclosures and disclaimers.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>As with other Content, PIXY assumes no liability for Sponsored Content Submitted by You or any other users of the Service, or for any product or service offered by or through Sponsored Content (“Sponsored Products and Services”). You shall be solely liable for Sponsored Content that You Submit to the Service and all elements of it, including without limitation for Sponsored Products and Services and for any other consequences of transmission of Sponsored Content through the Service.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>In addition to all other termination provisions set forth in the Terms of Use, PIXY reserves the right to terminate immediately Your access to the Service if You fail to make disclosures in any Sponsored Content You Submit in accordance with the FTC Guidelines or as otherwise required by applicable law. Further, in the event that Sponsored Content Submitted by You includes material or promotes products or services which, in PIXY’s sole opinion, might insult or offend users of the Service or which might tend to injure the success of the Service or the good name of PIXY, or if Your Sponsored Content does not comply with the Acceptable Use Policy set forth in Section 6 below, or, as determined in PIXY’s sole opinion, conflicts with or does not align with PIXY’s business, community, ethical or other goals, then PIXY shall have the right (a) to require that You cease submission of the Sponsored Content and/or (b) immediately terminate Your access to the Service.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>By Submitting Content to the Service, You are granting PIXY and its agents and designees a perpetual worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform such Content in connection with the Service and with the businesses of PIXY and those of its successors, licensees, and affiliates, including without limitation for the purpose of promoting and advertising the Service and redistributing part or all of the Service (and works derived therefrom) in any and all media formats and through any and all media channels now known or later developed.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Such additional uses by Instanza, or other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Instanza, may be made with no compensation paid to You with respect to the Content that You submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through PIXY.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Without limitation, the foregoing license includes the right of PIXY to grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access Your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service, subject to the Terms of Use. Such functionality currently includes the ability of users to capture segments from broadcasts of Content and to make such segments available on users’ own PIXY Account at the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display, perform, edit, modify and comment upon such segments via any and all channels of social media. (PIXY shall have the right but not the obligation to remove such segments from users’ account pages at the Service.)</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to permit use of such Content by users of the Service for endorsements of any product or service (other than the Service), or for any other commercial purpose, not authorized by You.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>In connection with the exercise of each of the foregoing rights licensed by You, You consent to use of Your name, image, likeness, photograph, performance, voice, biographical details, Facebook ID, Twitter handle, Instagram ID, profile pictures, and any other attributes of Your persona in any and all media now known or hereafter developed, including but not limited to the Internet (such as on the Site and on third party social media websites) and mobile applications, worldwide, in perpetuity; all without payment, compensation or further notification to or permission from You, except where prohibited by law.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>You hereby release and discharge all claims both known and unknown against, and covenant not to sue, PIXY and Related Parties (defined below) with respect to the use of any Content Submitted by You as authorized by the Terms of Use (including without limitation any claims that such use violates any proprietary right such as copyrights or rights of publicity/privacy).</span>

        <p class="head_top head_common">9. VIRTUAL CURRENCY/IN-SERVICE PURCHASES</p>
        <p class="text_top common_word">
          <span>At times, the Service will permit You to "buy", "purchase" or “exchange” for use in the Service: (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual diamonds or virtual stars; or (b) virtual in-Service items (“gifts”), including but not limited to jewelry and fashion items, cars, boats, stickers, or other gifts (together with virtual currency, "Virtual Items"). These real world terms, however, are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, PIXY grants You a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that include the use of these Virtual Items.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>A purchase of Virtual Items is complete only when you receive confirmation through the Service that You have redeemed iTunes or Google Play Store Wallet credits, or other third party currency accepted by the Service. When you use the third party payment system you will leave the PIXY and PIXY will not control such third party payment system and PIXY shall not be liable for any usage of the third party payment system. It is your obligation to confirm the terms and security of third payment system, if you do not agree to use such payment system, please do not submit your information to and make any payment on the third party payment system platform.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Any virtual currency balance shown in Your PIXY Account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of Your license to use the Virtual Items within the Service. PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to modify or revise the price of the Virtual Items and the exchange rate when converting stars to diamonds or stars to real currency from time to time. Further, PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to terminate Your exchange of stars into diamonds or real currency. You will not be able to receive a refund of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), including if Your access to the Service has been suspended, limited or terminated.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Tips and other Virtual Items gifted to broadcasters may result in some revenue to them as determined in PIXY's sole discretion; however, PIXY makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the Virtual Items You may give a broadcaster will correlate to the revenue such broadcaster may receive from PIXY. </span>
          <br><br>
          <span>PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to modify or revise the price of the Virtual Items and the exchange rate when converting stars to diamonds or stars to real currency from time to time. Further, PIXY reserves the right in its sole discretion with or without reason to stop the exchange of stars into diamonds or real currency. </span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Only users of the Service who initiate a broadcast will be eligible for Tips and other Virtual items. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="head_top head_common">10. RIGHT TO SHUT DOWN, DENY OR LIMIT ACCESS, REMOVE CONTENT</p>
        <p class="text_top common_word">
          <span>PIXY has the right, but not the obligation, to screen, refuse to post, remove or edit the Content (including any Sponsored Content), at any time and for any or no reason at all, in our sole discretion. PIXY takes steps to monitor Content and keep the Site, App, and Service safe, but PIXY cannot guarantee their safety. PIXY reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to remove Content, which is abusive, illegal or disruptive, or that otherwise fails to comply with the Terms of Use, and to limit or revoke Your access in full or in part to the Service, in our sole discretion, at any time, and for any reason, including, but not limited to reasons such as technical difficulties or violation of the Terms of Use.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to PIXY under the Terms of Use or applicable law, PIXY expressly reserves the right to suspend, limit or terminate Your access to the Service, at any time with or without notice and with or without cause, including if PIXY determines, in PIXY's sole discretion, that You pose a threat to the Service or its users. In addition, PIXY may refer any information on illegal activities, including Your identity, to the proper authorities.</span>
          <br><br>
          <span>Given that the Service is provided in real-time, we would appreciate Your help in reporting to us any Content that You believe violates the Terms of Use.
